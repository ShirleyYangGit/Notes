# Performance Metrics for Classification
The metrics that you choose to evaluate your machine learning model is very important. Choice of metrics influences how the performance of machine learning algorithms is measured and compared.

# Confusion Matrix 混淆矩阵

The Confusion Matrix tool aims to help you understand what happens under the hood, and to guide you to further tune Smart Ticket to achieve a satisfactory categorization accuracy.

A Confusion Matrix is basically a table to show users one specific test result. You can find out which categories are good or bad in this test, and then tune the system accordingly.
tu
The Confusion matrix in itself is not a performance measure as such, but almost all of the performance metrics are based on Confusion Matrix and the numbers inside it.

# Accuracy 准确率

Accuracy in classification problems is the number of correct predictions made by the model over all kinds predictions made.
